pytest-dependency - Manage dependencies of tests
================================================

This pytest plugin manages dependencies of tests.  It allows to mark
some tests as dependent from other tests.  These tests will then be
skipped if any of the dependencies did fail or has been skipped.


Download
--------

The latest release version can be found at PyPI, see

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest_dependency


System requirements
-------------------

+ Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2 and newer.
  Python 2.6 requires patching the sources, see below.
+ `setuptools`_.
+ `pytest`_ 2.8.0 or newer.

(Python 3.1 is not supported by pytest 2.8.0 itself.)


Installation
------------

1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.

2. Build (optional)::

     $ python setup.py build

3. Test (optional)::

     $ python -m pytest

4. Install::

     $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.

If you are using Python 2.6, apply python2_6.patch after the first
step:

1a. Patch::

     $ patch -p1 < python2_6.patch

It removes the use of certain language features (dict comprehensions)
that were introduced in Python 2.7.


Documentation
-------------

The directory doc/html in the source distribution contains the
documentation in HTML form generated by Sphinx.  The starting point is
doc/html/index.html.  The documentation can also be found online at

    https://pytest-dependency.readthedocs.io/

The example test modules used in the documentation can be found in
doc/examples in the source distribution.

pytest-dependency – Manage dependencies of tests
================================================

This pytest plugin manages dependencies of tests.  It allows to mark
some tests as dependent from other tests.  These tests will then be
skipped if any of the dependencies did fail or has been skipped.


Download
--------

The latest release version can be found `at PyPI`__.

.. __: `PyPI site`_


System requirements
-------------------

+ Python 3.4 and newer.
+ `setuptools`_.
+ `pytest`_ 3.7.0 or newer.

Optional library packages:

+ `setuptools_scm`_

  The version number is managed using this package.  All source
  distributions add a static text file with the version number and
  fall back using that if `setuptools_scm` is not available.  So this
  package is only needed to build out of the plain development source
  tree as cloned from GitHub.

+ `distutils-pytest`_ >= 0.2

  Only needed to run the test suite.


Installation
------------

1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.

2. Build (optional)::

     $ python setup.py build

3. Test (optional)::

     $ python setup.py test

4. Install::

     $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.


Documentation
-------------

See the `online documentation`__.

The example test modules used in the documentation can be found in
doc/examples in the source distribution.
